## SendUptimeToDiscord
A basic script that will send your routers uptime to a Discord webhook. 

Example:
```rsc
Router uptime: 01:11:40
Router uptime: 01:11:45
Router uptime: 01:11:50
Router uptime: 01:11:55
Router uptime: 01:12:00
Router uptime: 01:12:05
```
You might want to use this in your scheduler to send every 5s, or something similar.
